# PseudoQueue
  * Create a pseudoqueue with two stacks.

## Challenge
  * Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

## Approach & Efficiency
 * enqueue() O(1)
 * dequeue() O(n^2)
 * made sure everything was setup properly by consoling logging
 * work through each method one at a time.

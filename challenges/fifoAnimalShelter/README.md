# Animal shelter
  * Create a pseudoqueue with two stacks.

## Challenge
* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
 * enqueue() O(1)
 * dequeue() O(n^2)
 * made sure everything was setup properly by consoling logging
 * work through each method one at a time.

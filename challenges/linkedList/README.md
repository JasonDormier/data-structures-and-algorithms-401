# Linked List
  * create and travese a linked lists

## Challenge 01
 * Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  * Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  `{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL`

## Approach & Efficiency
 * `includes()` O(N) and `insert()` is O(1) toString() is O(N)
 * first get familair with the testing environment 
 * made sure everything was setup properly by consoling logging
 * work through each method one at a time.

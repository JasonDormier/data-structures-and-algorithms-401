# Hashtable
  * Hashtables

## Challenge 01
##### Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
 * first get familair with the testing environment 
 * made sure everything was setup properly by consoling logging
 * work through each method one at a time.
